      <h2>Sitka for the Summer</h2>
      <h3>May 27, 2019</h3>
      <p>I've been home in Sitka for three weeks. My Web Design grade has been posted now so I am free to work on this website in my freetime. Today I added a logo to my site that shows up on browser tabs. They're referred to as "favicons". It's interesting to design a 32 x 32px icon without Photoshop-- I used Krita, which is a free digital painting software. I also changed the site's address so that it's no longer located in my web-dev-hw repo.

      <h2>Finals Week</h2>
      <h3>April 29, 2019</h3>
      <p>Finals Week has come around at the University of Montana, which means I'm finishing up my sophomore year of college. This semester I took Intro to Web Design, Photoshop: Art and Design, Ilustrator: Vector Design and Layout, Intro to Ethics, and Parks and Outdoor Recreation Management. I will be heading back to Sitka for the summer. It will be good to be home, but I'll also miss all my Missoula adventures. Today I packed up the majority of my belongings, got my ulock unjammed, filled up my bike tires, and worked on this website for a few hours while sitting with my friends Allyson and Holly. It's also my brother's birthday today.
